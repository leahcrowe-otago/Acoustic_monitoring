# 1.1 Further deployment details

Acoustic data in this study included data collected between the start of the study (2022-Feb-15) and the latest date a recorder in a neighbouring fiord was still active (Hinenui-Nancy Sound, 2023-Nov-20). There were periods of no acoustic monitoring due to various reasons (e.g. battery lifespan and inability to access a site to service instruments). The equipment was deployed at the 'Marine Reserve-1' site in late December 2022 was not recovered/is missing. There was an acoustic release failure at the 'Marine Reserve-2', and there was no active recorder between January and the end of June 2023.

# 1.2 Additional R packages used

'cowplot' [@cowplot], 'ggplot' [@ggplot], 'ggpubr' [@ggpubr], 'ggrepel' [@ggrepel], 'lubridate' [@lubridate], 'dplyr' [@dplyr], 'marmap' [@marmap], 'sf' [@sf-2], 'stringr' [@stringr], 'tidyr' [@tidyr], 'readxl' [@readxl], 'viridis' [@viridis]

# 1.3 Details on other dolphins species

During regular survey effort in the Tamatea-Dusky complex, dusky dolphins were sighted near the 'Marine Reserve-2' site in November 2022, yet no whistles were detected by the automated detector or by manual browsing to further investigate vocalizations during this sighting. While dusky dolphins have the ability to whistle, they are considered to be a predominantly non-whistling species in Aotearoa-New Zealand, particularly when they are not in mixed groups with other dolphin species [@au2010]. Conversely, common dolphins are known to share similar echolocation click patterns [@soldevilla2008] and whistle frequency ranges as bottlenose dolphins [i.e @petrella2011; @boisseau2005]. A confounding factor particular to this study is that from the beginning of dedicated photo-identification efforts in the Tamatea-Dusky Sound complex, one common dolphin individual has been consistently associated with the bottlenose dolphin Dusky pod [@currey2008]. Aside from this ingratiated individual, the only common dolphins known to have been within the fiords during this study period was in Te Rā-Dagg Sound on 13 July 2022. Three individuals were sighted over 10 minutes beginning at 13:00 NZST, however, the only acoustic detections at the Te Rā-Dagg Sound site were later that evening from 20:24 NZDT making it difficult to draw an association between the acoustic and visual detections that day. Altogether, it is a reasonable assumption that bottlenose dolphins are the predominant species in the southern fiords.

The distance as the dolphin swims between two example re-sightings of individuals. a) At location #1 within the Patea-Doubtful complex, 37 Doubtful pod individuals were sighted on 2022-May-06 at 09:35 (NZST). At location #2 in Te Rā-Dagg Sound, 40 Doubtful pod individuals were sighted on 2022-May-07 08:59 (NZST). The two locations are 41 km apart, and 27 individuals were sighting in both locations. b) At location #1, a group of 30 Dusky pod individuals were sighted on 2022-Jul-12, including a mother/calf pair ('Ray'/'Sunshine'). This was the last sighting before they were observed stranded near Motupōhue-Bluff, location #2, on 2022-Sep-15. The two locations are 255 km apart.
