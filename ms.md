ABSTRACT

To provide effective management of protected species, a comprehensive understanding of their ecology is needed. Within the Te Moana o Atawhenua-Fiordland Marine Area (FMA), two of the four recognized bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) sub-populations are managed as though they exclusively inhabit discrete fiords systems; however, opportunistic sightings have suggested they occupy a larger space than is currently recognized. To investigate bottlenose dolphin presence in neighbouring fiord systems, acoustic monitoring equipment were deployed from February 2022 in Taiporoporo-Charles Sound, Hinenui-Nancy Sound, Te Ra-Dagg Sound, Taiari-Chalky Inlet, and Rakitimu-Preservation Inlet. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) devices include two approaches: F-PODs to detect click trains of odontocetes, and SoundTraps which provide broad spectrum recordings (sampling rate: 96 kHz on duty cycle). This study discusses the trade-offs between these two PAM approaches in terms of cost, recording duration, and the type of data collected. Opportunistic visual surveys were conducted during servicing trips in these areas, and photographed sightings from the public and local stakeholders were gathered to increase our understanding of the spatial extent of the different sub-populations. The results from this study demonstrate that bottlenose dolphins are regularly using fiords that are not currently considered part of their range within the FMA, and the 'resident' Doubtful and Dusky pods likely regularly inhabit larger territories than are recognized in current management schemes. Increased understanding of the spatial ecology for these sub-populations necessitates consideration of threats and resources both inside and outside of their namesake fiord complexes.

INTRODUCTION

Decreased photographic capture rates of Doubtful Sound dolphins were observed, beginning in 2009, and an observation of a group sighted in nearby Te Ra-Dagg Sound that same year suggested that the dolphins may not be as resident as originally thought . Prior to this observation, there were only a few instances where Doubtful Sound dolphins were missing from monitoring efforts, and this never exceeded more than three days [@henderson2013]. Since 2009, there have been additional sightings of the Patea-Doubtful Sound dolphins outside of their assumed range, including another sighting in Te Ra-Dagg Sound in 2016, Hinenui-Nancy Sound in 2019, and at the head of Vancouver Arm in Te Puaitaha-Breaksea Sound in 2020 (unpublished data). In addition, there have been opportunistic sightings of bottlenose dolphins in the Taiari-Chalky, Rakituma-Preservation Inlet, and Taiporoporo-Charles Sound, of which photographic analysis has shown they are not members of the previously described Doubtful or Dusky populations [@brager1998; unpublished data].

An improved understanding of the range of Fiordland bottlenose dolphins has important conservation implications. Firstly, if, for example, the Doubtful Sound population regularly uses habitats in other fiords, those areas may be as crucial to their survival as Patea-Doubtful/Te Awa-o-Tu-Thompson complex itself; therefore, it would be necessary to adjust spatial management in accordance with their understood range. Secondly, a distribution shift may be an indication that the environment within the fiords is changing. Climate change has been a factor altering cetacean breeding and feeding grounds across the globe, which has materialised in unanticipated animal movements [@derville2019; @meyer-gutbrod2017], and has threatened species' resilience [@meyer-gutbrod2021]. Thirdly, opportunistic bottlenose dolphin sightings in currently unmonitored fiords indicate that the sub-populations within Fiordland are not isolated. It has been suggested that specialised feeding strategies can influence social structures in bottlenose dolphins [@methion2019], and this may be a contributor to the long-term stability of the Doubtful resident population; previously, this population has been understood to primarily feed within the fiord system [@lusseau2003; @johnston2017]. Prey availability within the fiord is highly disjointed, and therefore vulnerable to environmental and/or anthropogenic effects [@lusseau2006]. If the distribution of food is changing, this may materialise in an observed change to the social structuring of the population.

METHODS

2.1 Passive acoustic monitoring

2.1.1 Deployment and maintenance

Mooring systems included a 50--70kg weight to a surface buoy in approximately 30m of water in all locations. FPODs were deployed alone in the outermost fiords (Taiporoporo-Charles Sound and Rakituma-Preservation Inlet), SoundTraps were deployed on the innermost fiords (Hinenui-Nancy Sound and Taiari-Chalky Inlet), and both an FPOD and a SoundTrap were deployed on the same line in Te Ra-Dagg Sound. PAM equipment was attached to the line approximately 10 meter from the bottom. FPODs and SoundTrap 600s were parameterized for continuous detections/recordings while SoundTrap model 300s were duty cycled to record for 15min within every 30min period at a sampling rate of 96kHz. Servicing schedules were largely dictated by platforms of opportunity, and under these parameters, anticipated recording times included 3 months for SoundTrap 300s with the external battery pack (1 month without it), up to 8.5 months for FPODs deployed with five alkaline and five lithium batteries, up to \# months for FPODs deployed with all alkalines, and \# months for SoundTrap 600s.

2.2 Photographed sightings

When weather and schedules allowed, visual surveys were conducted within the fiord to record and photograph dolphins sightings.
