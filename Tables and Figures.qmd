Fig. 1. Map of the study area including the acoustic recorders deployment locations within the Te Moana o Atawhenua-Fiordland Marine Area (all areas of the sea inshore of the teal line including all fiords). The neighbouring fiords are labeled in white text, all FMA marine reserves are in orange, and the two acoustic recorder sites within the Taumoana-Five Fingers Marine Reserve are numbered where 1. is the Cormorant Cove site, and 2. is the peninsula site. The 50m (grey) and 200m (dark blue) isobaths are provided on both maps. \u14ctepoti-Dunedin is marked as the yellow dot on the small inset map.

Fig. 5. Fiords where individuals alive since 2009 from the two Fiordland resident bottlenose dolphin sub-populations have been sighted. 'DOUBTFUL' = Patea-Doubtful complex, 'DUSKY' = Tamatea-Dusky complex, 'NANCY' = Hinenui-Nancy Sound, 'DAGG' = Te R$\mathrm{\bar{a}}$-Dagg Sound, 'PRESERVATION' = Rakitimu-Preservation Inlet, and 'BLUFF' refers to the stranding event at Motup$\mathrm{\bar{o}}$hue-Bluff. a) Individuals from the Doubtful pod ($n$ = 106). b) Individuals from the Dusky pod ($n$ = 178).

Fig. 6. The distance as the dolphin swims between two example re-sightings of individuals. a) At location #1 within the Patea-Doubtful complex, 37 individuals from the Doubtful pod were sighted on 2022-May-06 at 09:35 (NZST). At location #2 in Te R$\mathrm{\bar{a}}$-Dagg Sound, 40 Doubtful pod individuals were sighted on 2022-May-07 08:59 (NZST). The two locations are 41 km apart, and 27 individuals were sighting in both locations. b) At location #1, a group of 30 Dusky pod individuals were sighted on 2022-Jul-12, including a mother/calf pairs ('Ray'/'Sunshine'). This was the last sighting before they were observed stranded near Motup$\mathrm{\bar{o}}$hue-Bluff, location #2, on 2022-Sep-15. the two locations are approximately 255 km apart. Note the different color scales between plots a and b.
