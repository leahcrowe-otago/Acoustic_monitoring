# Tables

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

```

Table 1. Deployment and dolphin detection details for all sites included in this study. For each 'Fiord_recorder', ST = SoundTrap deployment, FPOD = FPOD deployment, and BOTH = dual deployment of a SoundTrap and an FPOD at the same location.

Table 3. Photographed bottlenose dolphin sightings in the neighbouring fiords as well the Doubtful and Dusky pod outside of their namesake fiord complexes reported from opportunistic efforts, dedicated survey, and during efforts to service acoustic monitoring gear. "Acoustic detections" indicate if dolphins were detected acoustically on the same day as the reported sighting if occurring during the acoustic study. $^\mathrm{a}$Henderson et al. 2013, $^\mathrm{b}$Brough et al. 2015.

Fig. 1. Map of the study area including the acoustic recorders deployment locations within the Te Moana o Atawhenua-Fiordland Marine Area (all areas of the sea inshore of the teal line including all fiords). The neighbouring fiords are labeled in white text, all FMA marine reserves are in orange, and the two acoustic recorder sites within the Taumoana-Five Fingers Marine Reserve are numbered where 1. is the Cormorant Cove site, and 2. is the peninsula site. The 50m (grey) and 200m (dark blue) isobaths are provided on both maps. Ōtepoti-Dunedin is marked as the yellow dot on the small inset map.

Fig. 3. Daily detected acoustic presence (green vertical lines) at each deployment site organized from north to south. The blue shaded areas are times when the SoundTrap (ST) was duty sampled to record 15 out of every 30 min, and the orange shaded areas are duty sampled ST data that were manually browsed due to sensitivity issues with the hydrophone. The grey shaded areas are times when the recorder was not active. The vertical red lines indicate when the gear was deployed/retrieved.

Fig. 4. Bottlenose dolphin acoustic detections at each site relative to the time of day. a) The timing of acoustic detections over the course of the entire study (black dots) where the dark grey shaded rectangles indicate periods when the device was not actively listening, and the orange rectangles are the periods where the acoustic files were browsed manually for daily presence (if presence was detected, the rest of the day was not normally analysed). b) Count of detection positive hours on a daily scale. In a) and b), the "Night" (blue) refers to the time between dusk and dawn.

Fig. 6. The distance as the dolphin swims between two example re-sightings of individuals. a) At location #1 within the Patea-Doubtful complex, 37 individuals from the Doubtful pod were sighted on 2022-May-06 at 09:35 (NZST). At location #2 in Te Rā-Dagg Sound, 40 Doubtful pod individuals were sighted on 2022-May-07 08:59 (NZST). The two locations are 41 km apart, and 27 individuals were sighting in both locations. b) At location #1, a group of 30 Dusky pod individuals were sighted on 2022-Jul-12, including a mother/calf pairs ('Ray'/'Sunshine'). This was the last sighting before they were observed stranded near Motupōhue-Bluff, location #2, on 2022-Sep-15. The two locations are 255 km apart. Note the different color scales for distance between plots a and b.

Fig. 7. Days when visual survey effort occurred in the Tamatea-Dusky Complex during the period when all three acoustic devices were active simultaneously (20-Feb-2022 through 30-Nov-2022). The lines reflect the survey effort that day with the shaded areas around the lines indicating times with bottlenose dolphins. The red dots represent the acoustic deployment sites, and the yellow and black dots indicate day-time and night-time acoustic presence, respectively, of dolphins at the site.
